This is a rather silly little script to send me an email and tell me when my next meeting is. The reason?

I don't have my work calendar accessible outside of my work computer. At various times I'll get asked a question the night before work, or the morning of work to do a thing (drive kids to school, make lunch etc). Or perhaps I just feel like going for a longer run that morning.

In that case it's good to know when the first meeting is. I've missed a few because I've made wrong assumptions and checking my work calendar means looking at work computer and before I know it I'm looking at slack, email, notifications and I'm working.

So this is a tool to help me avoid looking at my work computer.

You will need to add a `credentials.json` file from your Google API dashboard that gives you access to send emails and read the calendar. Honestly if you've read this far, well done, but you can probably accomplish this different ways and this is a silly solution.
